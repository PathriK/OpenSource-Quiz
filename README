This was a quiz web application developed for conducting an online quiz at college under Gyan - The Collective Learning, JSSATE OSUM (http://osum.sun.com/group/jssate).

This application was later customized to conduct another quiz in our college: http://osum.sun.com/profiles/blogs/placement-igi.

OpenSource Quiz was my first web application developed in October 2009. It uses the Apache Tomcat server.
